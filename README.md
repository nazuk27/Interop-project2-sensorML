# Real-time Monitoring Dashboard for Buoys Sensor using SensorML 
- Analysis and tracking of ocean water level and temperature from Sensor Grid deployed in the Indian Ocean.
- Developed interoperable WPS, WFS, WCS services for effective use of application across platform using SensorML.

As per the requirements, we have implemented all the required filtering.
1. Date Filtering
2. Observation Filtering with options of less than, less than equal to, greater than, greater than equal to and equal to option. This filtering can be seen in the chart.
3. Spatial Filtering - We have also provided bounding box coordinates to filter by spatial data.
